# Summary Report: “AWS Cloud Day Vietnam - AI Edition 2025”

&emsp;**Event Name:** Vietnam Cloud Day 2025  

&emsp;**Date:** September 18, 2025  

&emsp;**Location:** 2 Hai Trieu Street, Ben Nghe Ward, District 1, Ho Chi Minh City  

&emsp;**Role in the Event:** Participant  

## Event Objectives
The **AWS Cloud Day Vietnam - AI Edition 2025** is positioned as a pivotal gathering for the Vietnamese technology and business communities. The event's primary objective is to catalyze the digital transformation of Vietnam's economy by leveraging the symbiotic power of **Cloud Computing** and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**.

The overarching goals of the event can be categorized into four strategic pillars:

* **Democratizing Generative AI for Enterprise:** Moving Generative AI (GenAI) beyond hype to practical implementation. The goal is to demonstrate how businesses can transform generic AI solutions into sophisticated, context-aware programs, emphasizing a "comprehensive data strategy" as the key differentiator.
* **Dissolving Business-IT Boundaries:** Particularly within the Financial Services sector, bridging the gap between operational business goals and IT. The objective is to showcase cloud technology as a driver of business value, enabling "Ecosystem Banking" and "Embedded Finance" models.
* **Accelerating Industry-Specific Modernization:** Providing tailored roadmaps for diverse industries (Retail, Energy, Telco, Public Sector). Highlighting success stories like **Xanh SM**, **Honda Vietnam**, and **Masterise Group** to prove that modernization requires specific pathways, whether through migration or building cloud-native applications.
* **Fortifying Security and Resilience:** Instilling a "security by design" mindset. The aim is to teach attendees how to integrate security best practices throughout the entire application lifecycle—from development to production.

## Key Highlights

### The Strategic Convergence: Policy and Leadership
* **Government Endorsement:** Opening addresses by H.E. Pham Duc Long and H.E. Marc E. Knapper signal strong bilateral support for Vietnam's digital infrastructure.
* **Leadership Panels:** Moderated by Jeff Johnson, leaders like Vu Van (ELSA Corp) and Nguyen Hoa Binh (Nexttech Group) discussed how "People and Culture" drive cloud adoption.

### Track 1: Financial Services (FSI) – The New Banking Paradigm
* **Innovation in Banking & Insurance:** Techcombank and Bao Viet Holdings discussed the shift toward "Ecosystem Banking."
* **XGenAI Implementation:** Ngo Manh Ha (TechX) presented XGenAI, demonstrating how local partners build on AWS to deliver superior customer experiences in the financial sector.

### Track 2: Cross-Industry Modernization
* **Migration Success Stories:** Ha Anh Van shared Honda Vietnam's blueprint for SAP migration, moving from "lifting and shifting" to enhancing business value.
* **Digital Media & Telco:** VTV Digital and Mobifone shared their "From Vision to Value" digital transformation journeys.
* **Operational Excellence:** MegazoneCloud emphasized using AI to streamline processes and optimize costs post-migration.
* **Business Agility:** Masterise Group presented their strategy of migrating hundreds of VMware workloads to AWS.

### Track 3 & 4: Data, AI, and DevOps

## Key Takeaways

### Design Mindset
* **Business-Led Technology:** Shift mindset from IT-centric to business-centric (e.g., F88 improving financial access, Nam Long optimizing property management).
* **Resilience as a Standard:** Continuous resilience requires deliberate design utilizing cloud-native technologies.

### Technical Architecture
* **The Data-AI Dependency:** Generative AI cannot function without a Data Strategy. Output quality is proportional to data input quality.
* **Hybrid Pathways:**
    * Refactoring to microservices/serverless (e.g., TymeX).
    * Replatforming (e.g., Masterise Group moving VMware to AWS).

### Modernization Strategy
* **Beyond Migration:** The strategy is "Migrate to Operate"—focusing on continuous innovation after the move.
* **Ecosystem Integration:** For FSI, the strategy is Open Banking (exposing services via APIs).

### Applying to Work
1.  **Audit Data Readiness:** Conduct a data audit to ensure a "comprehensive data strategy" before initiating GenAI projects.
2.  **Pilot GenAI in DevOps:** Experiment with automated code generation and testing to measure delivery velocity.
3.  **Review Legacy Workloads:** Analyze Honda Vietnam and Masterise Group sessions to align SAP/VMware roadmaps with best practices.
4.  **Implement "Security at Scale":** Integrate security tools throughout the application lifecycle.

## Event Experience

Attending the **AWS Cloud Day Vietnam - AI Edition 2025** offered a comprehensive immersion into the future of Vietnam's digital economy. The event was a strategic forum linking national policy, business transformation, and technical implementation.

* **Learning from skilled speakers:** A balanced view of strategy versus execution was provided by speakers like Dr. Jens Lottner (Techcombank) and technical experts from TechX and Masterise.
* **Hands-on technical exposure:** Deep technical insights were gained, particularly regarding "Generative AI into the DevOps Lifecycle," showing the shift from manual coding to AI-assisted development.
* **Networking and discussions:** The event fostered dialogue between government officials, banking executives, and technical architects, highlighting that transformation involves culture as much as code.

### Lessons Learned
* **Data is the critical differentiator:** Without high-quality data, GenAI is just a novelty.
 * **Modernization is continuous:** It requires a shift to "smarter operations."
 * **Security is everyone's job:** It must be integrated from the first line of code.
