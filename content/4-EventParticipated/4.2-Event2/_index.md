# Summary Report: “Discover Agentic AI – Amazon QuickSuite Workshop”

### Event Objectives

-   **Demystify Agentic AI**: Define the shift from passive Generative AI to autonomous Agentic AI.
-   **Showcase Amazon QuickSuite**: Provide the first live demonstration of this solution in Vietnam.
-   **Enable Adoption**: Lower financial barriers through the AWS LIFT Program ($80,000 USD credit).
-   **Facilitate Hands-on Learning**: Offer a practical environment to build AI concepts with expert guidance.

### Speakers

-   **Vivien Nguyen** – Territory Manager, AWS
-   **Tung Cao** – Solution Architect, AWS
-   **Cloud Kinetics Team** – Strategic Implementation Partners

### Key Highlights

#### The Paradigm Shift: From Generative to Agentic
The workshop established a clear distinction between previous AI iterations and the current wave.
-   **Generative AI**: Focuses on creating content (text, images, code) based on prompts.
-   **Agentic AI**: Focuses on **autonomy** and **action**. These systems can perceive their environment, reason through complex workflows, and execute tasks independently without constant human intervention.



#### Unveiling Amazon QuickSuite
This event marked the first live demonstration of Amazon QuickSuite in Vietnam.
-   **Unified Ecosystem**: It seamlessly integrates data visualization (QuickSight) with generative capabilities (Quick Suite Q).
-   **Speed and Agility**: The "Quick" branding emphasizes rapid deployment, allowing businesses to move from concept to implementation in a short timeframe.
-   **Data-Centricity**: The suite is designed to process high volumes of data, which is a prerequisite for intelligent agents to make informed decisions.

#### Strategic Partnership & Support
-   **Collaboration with Cloud Kinetics**: The event highlighted that while AWS provides the platform, partners like Cloud Kinetics are essential for architectural guidance and "last-mile" implementation.
-   **Dual-Layer Support**: Attendees benefited from both platform experts (AWS) and consulting partners, de-risking the technical adoption process.

#### Financial Enablement: AWS LIFT Program
-   **$80,000 USD Credit**: A significant financial incentive was introduced to support new customers and SMBs.
-   **Risk Reduction**: This funding allows companies to experiment with high-performance computing and R&D without the immediate burden of infrastructure costs.

### Key Takeaways

#### Design Mindset
-   **Focus on Autonomy**: When designing for Agentic AI, the goal is to build systems that act on behalf of the user, not just assist them.
-   **Real-World Application**: Move beyond "hype" by identifying specific operational bottlenecks where an autonomous agent can add value (e.g., automated reporting, supply chain adjustments).

#### Technical Architecture
-   **The Ecosystem Approach**: Effective agents require a connected network of tools. QuickSuite acts as the connective tissue between data sources and action logic.
-   **Infrastructure Readiness**: Creating an AWS account and setting up the correct environment is the critical first step to accessing these advanced capabilities.

#### Strategic Implementation
-   **Information Asymmetry**: Early adopters of QuickSuite gain a competitive advantage by utilizing tools that the broader market has not yet mastered.
-   **Cost Management**: Leveraging programs like LIFT is crucial for accelerating time-to-market while managing cash flow.

### Applying to Work

-   **Explore QuickSuite**: Investigate how QuickSight and Quick Suite Q can be integrated into current data analytics workflows to create "Analyst Agents."
-   **Leverage Financial Incentives**: Apply for the AWS LIFT Program to secure credits for upcoming R&D projects.
-   **Identify Use Cases**: Audit internal business operations to find repetitive, multi-step tasks that are suitable for autonomous execution by Agentic AI.
-   **Collaborate with Partners**: Engage with solution partners like Cloud Kinetics for complex architectural needs rather than building entirely in-house.

### Event Experience

Attending the **“Discover Agentic AI”** workshop at the Bitexco Financial Tower was a highly professional and insightful experience. It provided a clear roadmap for the future of enterprise AI. Key experiences included:

#### Exclusive Access and Innovation
-   Being part of the **first-ever live demonstration** of Amazon QuickSuite in Vietnam provided a sense of being at the forefront of technology.
-   The venue at the **AWS Vietnam Office** underscored the commitment of AWS to the local market and provided a high-quality professional environment.

#### High-Value Hands-on Learning
-   The **90-minute workshop** session was instrumental. Unlike passive seminars, actually building concepts with **Quick Sight + Quick Suite Q** helped solidify the theoretical knowledge.
-   Having **AWS technical experts** available for over-the-shoulder mentorship allowed for immediate troubleshooting and deeper technical discussions.

#### Networking and Ecosystem
-   The extended lunch break and networking sessions offered valuable time to discuss strategies with peers and industry experts.
-   Understanding the role of the **Cloud Kinetics** partnership helped clarify how to bridge the gap between abstract platform capabilities and specific business solutions.

#### Lessons Learned
-   **Agentic AI is the future of operations**: The shift from "chatting with AI" to "AI doing the work" is inevitable and transformative.
-   **Speed is critical**: The tools are designed for rapid deployment ("QuickSuite"), suggesting that agility is the new metric for success.
-   **Funding accelerates innovation**: The LIFT program changes the conversation from "Can we afford this?" to "How fast can we start?"

> Overall, the workshop successfully demystified the complex concept of Agentic AI and provided the concrete tools, funding, and expertise required to start building immediately. It was a strategic intervention that empowered attendees to transform their business operations.
